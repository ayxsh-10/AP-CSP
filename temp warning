#also the hardest part to debug for all 3 coding mini-projects.
#testing helped find logical problems with the conditionals, and try new ways to solve problems, like the try and except function, which ended up being my best plan.
#i like to use comments, but im definetly going to check my code with a partner to gain feedback from them as well.
